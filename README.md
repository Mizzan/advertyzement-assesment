> Starting with this project was exciting as it was my job assessment. When I was making API calls then I was getting undefined value for few seconds later then the actual data.
>
> - So for solving this problem I used optional chaining ( ?. ) that gets data from deep down the objects if available if not then it does not gives error right away.
>
> I have used custom spinner here, although I thought using material-ui spinner or get it from react bootstrap but as I was using custom css/scss I thought using custom would be the right choice.
>
> Tried to keep code clean as much as possible, I know there's room for improvement.
